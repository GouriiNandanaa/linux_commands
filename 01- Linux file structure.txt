EVERYTHING IN THE LINUX IS A FILE

Eg:      Network Settings - IP Addresses
	 Devices - Printers, CD
	 Commands we are using

ðŸ”ºcd - change directory 
cd .. ---> for going to the previous directory
cd .. as many times
we will reach /
that is the root directory


ðŸ”ºls - list directory
In the root we have list of commands. It can be viewed if we type ls in the root directory

ðŸ”ºcat is the command for concatenate

ðŸ”ºcp means copy
cp file-name destination
Eg: cp ls networkcheck
it will cause some error
because we need permission
so we have to please Linux
pleasing is done by the command sudo
it stands for super user do

Here we can use the networkcheck command instead of ls
thats the use of ls actually
ie. If we simply type networkchect it will list the files and directory in that folder



ðŸ”ºrm - remove directory or file
rm ls
wont work
sudo rm ls
it will work
then if we type ls it wont work
so copy it back from the networkcheck
 


ðŸ”ºthere is one more file sbin in the root
sbin - super bin
it contains a list of files which need higher permission
like adduser
sudo adduser gourii
type the password and all


ðŸ”ºpwd - Present working directory



in the / dir, we have one usr directory
if we go to that and ls
then we can see one more bin and sbin
if cd bin , ls
same as previous bin and sbin

they are the same
the both are real
both are same
to check that 


ðŸ”ºwhich can be used for checking which is the location of the file we are going to use
which ls
	usr/bin/ls

ðŸ”ºin /usr we have one more imp dir which is local
here we can place the commands we are aerating


ðŸ”ºin / we have boot
this stores boot files
it includes log files, temporary file, apllication files, shared library files
 

ðŸ”ºin /
cd home
it will give the list of users
but not root user
every linux system has a root user


he is given separated in /
as root
sudo ls root
gives the directory in the root


ðŸ”ºthere is dev in /
devices
eg: vda1, vda these are virtual disk and they are also files


sudo cat vda
it will copy the things in the hard drive

ðŸ”ºsettings in Linux server or Linux computer is also files
things like network settings are stored in the files
Its stored in etc file
etcetera
configuration files are stored here


cd etc
cd network
ls
it will give a list including interfaces

sudo  cat interfaces
not working


ðŸ”ºmnt/media
both have similar functionalities
they mount drives
if we plugin usb drive
it will automatically mounted to media as a file

mnt use manually mounting



linus file system is known as FILE SYSTEM HEIRARCHY(FHS)
