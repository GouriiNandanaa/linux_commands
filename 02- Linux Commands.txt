OPERATING SYSTEM HISTORY
https://eylenburg.github.io/os_familytree.htm


Initially its UNICS
Most of the other OS comes related and after to this
Like iOS, appletvOs, macOS, Android
They are in red color and they have share similar commands 

But Windows is separate one (BLUE)
not related to UNICS OS back in 70s


UNIX
-----
mid 1960s
grandfather of many modern operating systems that we frequently used today
Multi user operating systems and hierarchical file systems



OS can be grouped into 2 families
	Microsoft NT
windows, Xbox OS and Windows Phone/Mobile

	UNIX
max OS X, Linux, Android, Chrome OS, PS4 OS


3 kinds of OS based on type of source
	open source
	closed source
	mixed/ shared source



FREE SOURCE MOVEMENT - RICHARD STALLMAN
free is not based on the concept of money
but based on the freedom
	"users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the s/w"



GNU
----
Free software alternative to Unix
1984
everything that comes under Unix system but Free



The Linux Kernel
-----------------
Linus Torvalds
working on creating his own kernel known as Linux
At that time GNU pieces were complete 
but lacked a kernel
He combined his kernel with the existing GNU components to create a full OS 
A kernel is the core of an operating system (OS), acting as the central interface between the hardware and software. 


GNU/LINUX
----------
GNU/Linux is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system consisting of components developed by the GNU Project and the Linux kernel. It's not a single entity, but rather a collection of software, including the Linux kernel, and other software developed by the GNU Project, such as compilers, libraries, and utilities. The Linux kernel is the core component that manages hardware, while the GNU components provide the tools and libraries needed for users to interact with the system. 

SHELL
----
IN WONDOWS power shell , bash
its a computer interface to an os
shell exposes os services to human user to other programs
it takes our command and give them to the os to perform

its the outer layer of the os - so the name shell


TERMINAL
-------
Program that  runs the shell
they were physical devices initially
now its a software

 ubunu, linus ---> BASH
mac ------> ZSH
Fish




BASH  
Bourne Again SHell
in most Linux based systems, default shell is bash
same or similar in Unix or Unix based systems
